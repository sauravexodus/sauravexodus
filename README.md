### Hello, Namaste 🙏🏻

I'm a passionate iOS/ Android/ React/ React Native Developer with **5 years** of experience. I'm good with Typescript, Javascript, Swift, Functional programming, Clean Architecture, VIPER, Redux, RxJS, RxSwift, and MVI. I am an active contributor to the open source world and a member of the popular RxSwiftCommunity since 2017.

#### 📰 Articles
I love writing about stuff as well. Here are some of the articles that I have published on Medium:

- [Unit Testing in iOS using Quick, Nimble & RxBlocking](https://medium.com/getpulse/unit-testing-in-ios-using-reactorkit-quick-nimble-rxblocking-swift-4-1-a01ccbaff44b)
- [Designing apps for multiple sizes](https://medium.com/getpulse/adaptive-ui-for-multiple-screen-sizes-in-ios-fd8c6999a0a3)

I contribute across the stack at this moment (Backend, Frontend, and Native Apps).
