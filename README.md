### Hello, Namaste 🙏🏻

I'm a passionate iOS/ Android/ React/ React Native Developer with **10 years** of experience. I'm good with Go, Typescript, Javascript, Swift, Functional programming, Clean Architecture, VIPER, Redux, RxJS, RxSwift, and MVI. I am an active contributor to the open source world and a member of the popular RxSwiftCommunity since 2017.
